//! Resolve the actual state of a VM by reconciling DB record,
//! process liveness, and agent reachability.
//!
//! Three signals can disagree:
//!
//! - `record.state` — what we last persisted (e.g., `Running` after
//!   a successful start).
//! - `is_process_alive(pid)` — whether the libkrun VMM process is
//!   still around. Cheap (`kill(pid, 0)` + start-time match).
//! - vsock ping — whether the guest agent inside the VM responds.
//!   The only signal that proves the VM is *useful*; everything
//!   else is approximation.
//!
//! The combinations and their resolutions:
//!
//! | record.state | PID alive | ping ok | resolved state |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Running | yes | yes | Running |
//! | Running | yes | no  | **Unreachable** ← the bug 2 case |
//! | Running | no  | yes | Running (macOS PID-not-visible edge case) |
//! | Running | no  | no  | Stopped |
//! | Stopped/Created/Failed | * | * | record.state (no probe) |
//!
//! Used by:
//! - CLI `machine list` — so the column shows the truth.
//! - HTTP API list/get/exec handlers — same reason.
//! - CLI `machine start --name` — to detect the Unreachable state
//!   and recover by killing the zombie VMM.
