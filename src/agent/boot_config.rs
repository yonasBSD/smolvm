//! Boot configuration for subprocess-based VM launch.
//!
//! On macOS, `fork()` in a multi-threaded process (e.g., the tokio-based API
//! server) creates unstable children because Apple frameworks like
//! Hypervisor.framework detect the forked state and abort. To avoid this,
//! the server spawns a fresh single-threaded `smolvm _boot-vm` subprocess
//! that safely runs `krun_start_enter`.
//!
//! This module defines the serializable config passed to that subprocess.
